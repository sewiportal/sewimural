    <h2>Buy Pixels</h2>
    <p class="sansserif">Do YOU want a permanent ad linked to your website drawing in customers from all over SE Wisconsin? Of course you do! That's why Adam and Matt aregiving you a chance to own a 25 pixel by 25 pixel square, or 625 pixels worth of ad space for just 25 cents a pixel! That's just 156.25 dollars for a permanent ad and an easy way to go down in Internet history! And that's just the minimum order requirements! You can order up to a 175 by 175 pixel ad, coming down to just 7656.25 dollars for 30,625 pixels worth of linked ad space! And it gets better! You can order ads in any dimensions, provided that both of the dimensions are a multiple of 25 (pixels) and are at least 25 (pixels) and no greater than 175 (pixels). The quicker you inquire, the more likely your ad will appear on the home page, the first page people see when they go to this website! Once the home page is full, we will progress to page one, then page two, and so on. In other words, the quicker you order, the more people will see your ad! Please send your SERIOUS inquiries, orders, and payments (in PayPal only) IN SEPERATE EMAILS to insert email here. All orders must also include a message to display when the ad is being hovered over. You may include a link to your website in your order, and links do not affect the price of an ad. However, all links included MUST be to a reputable website secured with HTTPS. NO VIRUSES. That is all for now. Ta-ta! -Adam</p>
